# Difficulty Settings Mod

Play the game how you want. Find it too hard? Choose the Easy or Very Easy setting. Find it too easy, there's a setting for you, too.

# Difficulty Levels

* Very Easy - Enemies are 40% weaker than normal, food is created faster, portals and pirates appear less frequently
* Easy - Enemies are 20% weaker than normal
* Normal - Play is normal, but you might tweak some of the setting in the Features section.
* Challenging - Enemies are 25% stronger.
* Hard - Enemies are 50% stronger.
* Very Hard - Enemies are 75% stronger, food takes longer to create, portals and pirates appear more frequently
* Nigh Impossible - Enemies are 100% stronger, food takes longer to create, portals and pirates appear more frequently

# Other things affected by Difficulty Level

* When you receive a second Villager should you be reduced to only one. (Only at the Very Easy and Very Hard levels)
* Food produces faster or slower at Very Easy/Very Hard difficulty.
* DLC: Some Greed demands require more items or less time at Very Hard or higher. The opposite is true in Very Easy difficulty
* DLC: Happiness takes longer/shorter time to generate at Very Hard/Very Easy.
* DLC: Lifespan of villagers is longer for Very Easy. It is short for Very Hard. And Old Villagers cannot be put on the house for Very Hard.

# Selectable Features

* Summoned items can be restricted to being summoned in a specific part of the board: Center, Upper Left, Upper Right, Lower Left, Lower Right, or continue to appear Anywhere.
* Strange Portals can be disabled or just the Rare Portals can be disabled.
* Pirate Ships can be disabled.
* Purple Locations (Mountains, Graveyards, etc) can be prevented from summoning enemies.
* Animals can be set not to roam (making animal pens and aquariums unnecessary except to allow the animals to be stacked).
* Storage can be made worse, normal, or better. Worse Sheds store 3 cards, while Better Sheds store 5. Warehouses store 12/14/17 cards respecitively.

Additionally, you can set it so that DLC Curses are available in any game started, whether or not they have been defeated in that save game.

# Other Suggestions

* The [No More Hunger](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3011864939&searchtext=) Mod can also be used to make the game harder by setting the food setting to 3 per moon.
* The [Strict Mode](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3026405806&searchtext=) Mod makes it so you cannot use a recipe until you have found the idea.

# Potential Conflict

I don't run these mods so I don't know if there are conflicts. Be forewarned.

* The [Curse Unlock](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2998501721&searchtext=) Mod does the same thing this mod does with making Curses available on the New Game Screen. There could be a conflict.
