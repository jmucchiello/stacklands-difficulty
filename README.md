# Difficulty Settings Mod

Play the game how you want. Find it too hard? Choose the Easy or Very Easy setting. Find it too easy, there's a setting for you, too.

# Difficulty Levels

* Very Easy - Enemies are 40% weaker than normal, food is created faster, portals and pirates appear less frequently
* Easy - Enemies are 20% weaker than normal
* Normal - Play is normal, but you might tweak some of the setting in the Features section.
* Challenging - Enemies are 25% stronger.
* Hard - Enemies are 50% stronger.
* Very Hard - Enemies are 75% stronger, food takes longer to create, portals and pirates appear more frequently
* Brutal - Enemies are 100% stronger, food takes longer to create, portals and pirates appear more frequently

# Other things affected by Difficulty Level

* When your second villager spawns, whether early game or because of combat loses. (Only at the Very Easy and Very Hard+ levels)
* Food produces faster or slower at Very Easy/Very Hard difficulty.
* DLC: Some Greed demands require more items or less time at Very Hard or higher. The opposite is true in Very Easy difficulty
* DLC: Happiness takes longer/shorter time to generate at Very Hard/Very Easy.
* DLC: Lifespan of villagers is longer for Very Easy. It is short for Very Hard. And Old Villagers cannot be put on the house for Very Hard.

# Selectable Game Play Features

These features are independent of the difficulty level.

* Summoned items can be restricted to being summoned in a specific part of the board: Center, Upper Left, Upper Right, Lower Left, Lower Right,
or continue spawning Anywhere on the board.
* Strange Portals can be disabled or just the Rare Portals can be disabled.
* Pirate Ships can be disabled.
* Purple Locations (Mountains, Graveyards, etc) can be prevented from spawning enemies.
* Animals can be set not to roam (making animal pens and aquariums unnecessary except to allow the animals to be stacked).
* Storage can be made small, normal, large, or huge. Sheds store 3/4/5/10 cards. Warehouses store 12/14/17/30 cards.
* DLC: You can set it so that DLC Curses are available in any game started, whether or not they have been defeated in that save game.

# Selectable Mod Features

* The difficulty level can be displayed on screen to the left of the resources information box.
* A button to toggle Peaceful Mode on and off can also appear on screen. Changing peaceful mode
during play will not remove any existing enemies from the game. But it will prevent new ones from appearing.

# Other Suggested Mods

* The [No More Hunger](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3011864939&searchtext=) Mod can also be used to make the game harder by setting the food setting to 3 or more per villager per moon or easier by setting it to 1 or zero per moon.
* The [Strict Mode](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3026405806&searchtext=) Mod makes it so you cannot use a recipe until you have found the idea.

# Potential Conflicts

I don't run these mods so I don't know if there are conflicts. Be forewarned.

* The [Curse Unlock](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2998501721&searchtext=) Mod does the same thing this mod does with making Curses available on the New Game Screen. There could be a conflict.
* I don't know if or how the [No Pushing](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3017201909&searchtext=) Mod would be affected by how I immobilize animals.
* I don't know how [Compact Storage](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3012122691&searchtext=) interacts with my changes to sheds and warehouses.
